# Spreadsheet for WinForms - How to Assign Custom In-Place Editors to Worksheet Cells

This example demonstrates how to use custom editors for in-place editing of cell content. Both predefined editors supported by the **SpreadsheetControl** for in-place editing ([ComboBoxEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.ComboBoxEdit), [DateEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.DateEdit), and [CheckEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.CheckEdit)) and the custom editor ([SpinEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.SpinEdit)) are used to edit cells located in the specific columns of a worksheet table.

## Implementation Details

To assign an in-place editor of a predefined type to a specific cell range in a worksheet, use the `Add` method of the [CustomCellInplaceEditorCollection](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.Spreadsheet.CustomCellInplaceEditorCollection)Â collection, which stores the custom cell editors specified in a worksheet.

To assign your own custom editor to a cell, handle the [SpreadsheetControl.CustomCellEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraSpreadsheet.SpreadsheetControl.CustomCellEdit)Â event. This event fires when a user is about to start editing a cell. and allows you by Set a corresponding [RepositoryItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.Repository.RepositoryItem)Â descendant to the event's `RepositoryItem` parameter to supply a custom in-place editor to the edited cell.
